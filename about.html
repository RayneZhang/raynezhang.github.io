            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a senior student in the School of Software, <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.
                I am a research member at <a href="http://dalab.se.sjtu.edu.cn">the Digital ART Lab</a> of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
                I have also conducted research at <a href="http://cascade.cs.illinois.edu/">Cascade Lab in University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</a>.
            </p>
            <p>My research interests lie primarily in the fields of <em><b>Human Computer Interaction</b></em>, <em><strong>Game Design and Mixed Reality</strong></em>.
                I design interfaces, especially games, to help people gain better experiences and improve their lives.
                I'm hoping to build novel interactive interfaces in a playful and aesthetic way. You can check out some of my projects/portfolio <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I am a rapper and I create my own music! I write, record and produce music in my studio.
                You can check out some of my songs <a href="music.html">here</a>. I am often invited to give performances on and off campus. Check out some of my performances <a href="music.html#performances">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:rayne_@sjtu.edu.cn">Email</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RayneZhang/">Github</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RayneZL">Facebook</a>.</p>
