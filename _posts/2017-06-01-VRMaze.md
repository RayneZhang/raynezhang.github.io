This is the capstone project of the course Human-Computer Interaction. This game called VR Maze aims to train people's navigation abilities. The player is put in a randomly generated maze at the beginning of the game. Given a randomly generated destination and the limited time to memorize the route on the minimap, the player will navigate in the maze using HTC VIVE handler. The amount of time that the player takes measures the player's navigation ability. The player wins the game once he/she reaches the destination. This project ranked the 1st out of 43 students in the course Human-Computer Interaction.
