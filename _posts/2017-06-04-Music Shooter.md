This is a VR music shooting game that I implemented independently. In this project I tried to combine as many gaming elements as I could to build a musical game in VR that never existed before. The game is called Music Shooter. In this game, the player shoots the targets according to the rhythm of the music. The player will be scored by the accuracy of his/her hitting the rhythm. At the same time, players can use props to increase HP or score, enhancing the uncertainty of the game.
