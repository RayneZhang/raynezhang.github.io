This is a project supported by the National University Student Innovation Program. I led 3 team members to develop an Android APP for family members to share their schedules and personal goals as well as supervising and interacting with each other, with the goal of strengthening family bonds. In this project, I designed the ways of interactions among family members in the APP including likes, dislikes, various punishments, etc. I also implemented all features of the client using skills of android programming, network programming and database programming in Java.
