**MY CONTRIBUTIONS**

In this project I mainly implemented the calibration between a Microsoft Kinect and an HD camera as well as the interactions between the user and virtual models using poses and voice commands.

<h3 class="section-title text-center">Introduction</h3>
In this system, we propose a new multimodal interface named "Pose-Shell-Speech", which is more effective and natural in manipulating virtual objects when comparing with the gesture-only interface. Apart from that, users can do a series of basic editing operations including adding, moving, deleting virtual objects through an interactive way even when the system is running, and this system has a good scalability, which lays a good groundwork for the augmented reality TV system in interactive editing.
