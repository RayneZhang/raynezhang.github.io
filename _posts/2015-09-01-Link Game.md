This is a little game that I developed when I was a freshman in university. In this game called Link Game, players need to find two cards with the same pattern but no more than 3 straight lines to connect them. I used the tool FLTK, an old but useful GUI tool to implement the game. The main logic contains randomly generating the map, eliminating two cards, recording time and score, determining the condition of winning, etc. I implemented this game as a practice of object-based programming of C++ and it got A+ in the course "Curriculum Design of Programming".
