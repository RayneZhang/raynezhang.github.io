<p>I am a senior student in the <a href="http://en.se.sjtu.edu.cn/">School of Software</a> at <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>. I am a research member at the <a href="http://dalab.se.sjtu.edu.cn">Digital ART Lab</a> of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by <a href="http://dalab.se.sjtu.edu.cn/www/home/?page_id=143">Xubo Yang</a> and <a href="http://en.se.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/teacherdetail.aspx?id=21">Shuangjiu Xiao</a>.

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of <b>Human Computer Interaction</b>, <strong>Mixed Reality and Game Design</strong>. I combine my love of computer science, music and art to create novel interactive technologies. I hope to work on combining mixed reality and game design with qualitative and quantitative research methods to help people gain better experiences and strengthen their abilities.
